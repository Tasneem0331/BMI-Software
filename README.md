The BMI Calculator is a feature-rich Java application designed to assist users in understanding their health metrics. It allows users to input their age, gender, weight, and height to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and determine their health category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, or obese). Additionally, the application calculates and displays the standard weight range for the user based on their height and gender, offering personalized insights.
